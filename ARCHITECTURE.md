## Data Flow & Orchestration

### Workflow Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**
   ```python
   # User submits profile through Streamlit
   POST /v1/langgraph/generate-fitness-plan/
   {
       "user_id": "user_123",
       "generate_meal_plan": true,
       "generate_workout_plan": true,
       "days": 7,
       "meal_preferences": {"days": 7, "meal_count": 3},
       "workout_preferences": {"days_per_week": 4}
   }
   ```

2. **Profile Processing**
   - LangGraph invokes Profile Manager Agent
   - Agent calculates BMR, TDEE, and macro targets
   - Results stored in workflow state

3. **Plan Generation**
   - Meal Planner and Workout Planner agents process user profile data
   - Each agent has access to profile data from state
   - Vector search and database queries executed

4. **Plan Synthesis**
   - Summary Agent combines all outputs
   - Generates coherent implementation guidance
   - Creates motivational content

5. **Response Delivery**
   ```json
   {
       "summary": "Your personalized 7-day plan...",
       "meal_plan": {...},
       "workout_plan": {...},
       "execution_steps": ["Profile analyzed", "Meal plan created", ...],
       "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
   }
   ```

### State Management

LangGraph maintains state throughout the workflow:

```python
class WorkflowState:
    user_profile: Dict
    nutrition_targets: Dict
    meal_plan: Dict
    workout_plan: Dict
    execution_log: List[str]
    errors: List[str]
```

## Vector Search & RAG

### USDA Nutrition Database

**Data Size**: 3.1GB JSON file with 300k+ branded foods
**Storage**: MongoDB for structured queries
**Vector Search**: FAISS for semantic similarity

### Vector Embedding Process

1. **Enhanced Food Description Embedding**
   ```python
   # Create rich embeddings for food descriptions with context
   def create_enhanced_description(food_item):
       return f"{food_item['description']} {food_item.get('brand_owner', '')} "\
              f"ingredients: {food_item.get('ingredients', '')} "\
              f"serving: {food_item.get('serving_size', '')} "\
              f"category: {food_item.get('food_category', '')}"
   
   descriptions = [
       create_enhanced_description(food) for food in nutrition_data
   ]
   
   # Batch processing for efficient embedding creation
   batch_size = 100
   for i in range(0, len(descriptions), batch_size):
       batch = descriptions[i:i+batch_size]
       embeddings = embedding_model.embed_documents(batch)
       faiss_index.add(embeddings)
   ```

2. **Advanced Hybrid Search Implementation**
   ```python
   def search_nutrition_hybrid(query: str, limit: int = 10, semantic_weight: float = 0.7):
       # Semantic search component
       query_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query(query)
       semantic_distances, semantic_indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, limit * 2)
       
       # Traditional text search component
       text_results = mongo_collection.find(
           {"$text": {"$search": query}},
           {"score": {"$meta": "textScore"}}
       ).limit(limit * 2)
       
       # Hybrid scoring and ranking
       combined_results = []
       for i, idx in enumerate(semantic_indices[0]):
           food_id = food_index[idx]
           semantic_score = 1 / (1 + semantic_distances[0][i])  # Convert distance to similarity
           
           # Get text search score if available
           text_score = 0
           for text_result in text_results:
               if text_result['fdc_id'] == food_id:
                   text_score = text_result.get('score', 0)
                   break
           
           # Combine scores
           final_score = (semantic_weight * semantic_score) + ((1 - semantic_weight) * text_score)
           combined_results.append((food_id, final_score))
       
       # Sort by combined score and return top results
       combined_results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
       top_food_ids = [result[0] for result in combined_results[:limit]]
       
       return mongo_collection.find({"fdc_id": {"$in": top_food_ids}})
   ```

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Process**:
1. User requests "high protein breakfast options"
2. Vector search finds relevant foods: greek yogurt, eggs, protein powder
3. LLM generates meal combinations using retrieved foods
4. Output includes specific nutrition data and preparation instructions

**Example**:
```python
def generate_meal_with_rag(meal_type: str, macro_targets: dict):
    # Search for relevant foods
    relevant_foods = vector_search.similarity_search(
        f"{meal_type} high protein {macro_targets['primary_macro']}"
    )
    
    # LLM creates meal using retrieved foods
    meal = llm.invoke([
        ("system", "Create a meal using these specific foods..."),
        ("human", f"Foods: {relevant_foods}, Targets: {macro_targets}")
    ])
    
    return meal
```

# Sampled Foods Process

## Overview

The AI Fitness Planner implements a sophisticated food sampling system that creates representative subsets of the massive USDA nutrition database for efficient processing and improved user experience. This system balances comprehensive nutrition data access with performance optimization by intelligently sampling foods across macro categories.

## Data Challenge

**Scale**: The complete USDA FoodData Central branded foods dataset contains over 300,000 food items in a 3.1GB JSON file, making it impractical to process in real-time for every user request.

**Solution**: Implement a smart sampling strategy that maintains nutritional diversity while reducing dataset size by 98% (from 300K+ to 5K foods) without losing essential food variety.

## Sampling Strategy

### Even Distribution Across Macro Categories

The sampling process ensures balanced representation across four primary macro categories:

```python
macro_categories = ["high_protein", "high_fat", "high_carb", "balanced"]
foods_per_category = sample_size // len(macro_categories)  # 1,250 foods per category for 5K sample
```

### Category Definitions

Foods are classified based on their macronutrient profile (per 100g):

- **High Protein**: ≥40% of calories from protein
- **High Fat**: ≥40% of calories from fat  
- **High Carb**: ≥40% of calories from carbohydrates
- **Balanced**: No single macro exceeds 40% of calories

### Sampling Algorithm

```python
@nutrition_setup.post("/sample_usda_data/")
async def sample_usda_data(
    file_path: str = "./fast_api/app/api/nutrition_data/extracted/FoodData_Central_branded_food_json_2025-04-24.json",
    sample_size: int = 5000,
):
    """
    Sample USDA Branded Foods data evenly across macro categories
    
    Process:
    1. Query MongoDB for foods by macro category
    2. Random sample from each category
    3. Extract specific foods from USDA JSON
    4. Enhance with nutrition calculations
    5. Save optimized dataset
    """
```

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: MongoDB Category Sampling

```python
# Connect to preprocessed MongoDB collection
client = get_mongo_client()
collection = db["branded_foods"]

# Sample evenly from each macro category
for category in macro_categories:
    query = {
        "nutrition_enhanced.macro_breakdown.primary_macro_category": category,
        "nutrition_enhanced": {"$exists": True},
        "fdcId": {"$exists": True}
    }
    
    # Get all foods in category and randomly sample
    foods_in_category = list(collection.find(query, {"fdcId": 1, "_id": 0}))
    sampled_foods = random.sample(foods_in_category, category_sample_size)
    all_sampled_fdc_ids.extend([food["fdcId"] for food in sampled_foods])
```

### Phase 2: Efficient JSON Extraction

```python
# Use ijson for memory-efficient streaming of large JSON file
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    parser = ijson.items(f, "BrandedFoods.item")
    
    for food in parser:
        food_fdc_id = str(food.get("fdcId", ""))
        if food_fdc_id in fdc_id_set:
            sampled_foods.append(food)
            fdc_id_set.remove(food_fdc_id)  # Remove to avoid duplicates
            
            # Stop when all foods found
            if not fdc_id_set:
                break
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Nutrition Processing

Each sampled food undergoes comprehensive nutrition enhancement:

#### Per-100g Standardization
```python
def calculate_per_100g_values(food_item):
    """Calculate standardized per-100g nutrition values"""
    serving_size = food_item.get("servingSize", 100)
    multiplier = 100 / serving_size
    
    # Extract key nutrients by USDA nutrient IDs
    nutrient_map = {
        1008: "energy_kcal",    # Energy
        1003: "protein_g",      # Protein  
        1004: "total_fat_g",    # Total Fat
        1005: "carbs_g",        # Carbohydrates
        1079: "fiber_g",        # Fiber
        2000: "sugars_g",       # Sugars
        1093: "sodium_mg",      # Sodium
        1253: "cholesterol_mg", # Cholesterol
        1258: "saturated_fat_g",# Saturated Fat
        1257: "trans_fat_g",    # Trans Fat
    }
    
    for nutrient_id, nutrient_name in nutrient_map.items():
        amount = extract_nutrient_by_id(food_nutrients, nutrient_id)
        per_100g[nutrient_name] = round(amount * multiplier, 2)
```

#### Nutrition Density Scoring
```python
def calculate_nutrition_density_score(per_100g):
    """Calculate nutrition quality score"""
    protein = per_100g.get("protein_g", 0)
    fiber = per_100g.get("fiber_g", 0)
    calories = per_100g.get("energy_kcal", 1)
    
    if calories > 0:
        return round((protein + fiber) / calories * 100, 2)
    return 0
```

#### Macro Breakdown Analysis
```python
def calculate_macro_breakdown(per_100g):
    """Calculate detailed macronutrient analysis"""
    protein_g = per_100g.get("protein_g", 0)
    fat_g = per_100g.get("total_fat_g", 0)
    carbs_g = per_100g.get("carbs_g", 0)
    
    # Calculate calories from each macro
    calories_from_protein = protein_g * 4
    calories_from_fat = fat_g * 9
    calories_from_carbs = carbs_g * 4
    total_calculated_kcal = calories_from_protein + calories_from_fat + calories_from_carbs
    
    # Calculate percentages and categorization
    if total_calculated_kcal > 0:
        pct_protein = (calories_from_protein / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        pct_fat = (calories_from_fat / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        pct_carbs = (calories_from_carbs / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        
        # Determine macro categories
        macro_categories = []
        if pct_protein >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_protein")
        if pct_fat >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_fat")
        if pct_carbs >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_carb")
        
        return {
            "protein_percent": round(pct_protein, 1),
            "fat_percent": round(pct_fat, 1),
            "carbs_percent": round(pct_carbs, 1),
            "macro_categories": macro_categories,
            "primary_macro_category": determine_primary_macro(pct_protein, pct_fat, pct_carbs),
            "is_high_protein": pct_protein >= 40,
            "is_high_fat": pct_fat >= 40,
            "is_high_carb": pct_carbs >= 40,
            "is_balanced": len(macro_categories) == 0,
        }
```

## Enhanced Data Structure

### Comprehensive Food Object
Each sampled food includes enhanced nutrition data:

```json
{
  "fdcId": 123456,
  "description": "Greek Yogurt, Plain, Nonfat",
  "brandOwner": "Brand Name",
  "ingredients": "Cultured nonfat milk, live cultures",
  "servingSize": 170,
  "nutrition_enhanced": {
    "serving_info": {

    dietary_restrictions: List[str] = None,
    min_protein: float = None,
    max_calories: float = None,
    semantic_weight: float = 0.7
):
    # Hybrid search with nutrition filtering
    results = search_nutrition_hybrid(query, semantic_weight=semantic_weight)
    
    # Apply dietary restriction filters
    if dietary_restrictions:
        results = filter_dietary_restrictions(results, dietary_restrictions)
    
    # Apply nutrition criteria filters
    if min_protein or max_calories:
        results = filter_nutrition_criteria(results, min_protein, max_calories)
    
    # Calculate nutrition density scores
    scored_results = calculate_nutrition_scores(results)
    
    return scored_results
```

### 2. **Enhanced Workflow Coordination**

## Conclusion

The AI Fitness Planner represents a sophisticated application of LangGraph and LLM technologies to create personalized, intelligent fitness and nutrition recommendations. By orchestrating multiple specialized agents through LangGraph workflows, the system delivers comprehensive plans that consider user goals, preferences, restrictions, and available resources.

The architecture demonstrates several key advantages:

- **Multi-agent coordination** enables complex reasoning beyond single LLM capabilities
- **Vector search integration** provides access to vast nutrition databases
- **State management** ensures consistency across all plan components
- **Modular design** allows for easy expansion and improvement

This implementation serves as a practical example of how LangGraph can be used to build production-ready applications that combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with structured data and domain-specific logic.

The system's ability to generate personalized, actionable fitness plans while maintaining transparency in decision-making makes it a powerful tool for both users seeking fitness guidance and developers learning to implement LangGraph workflows.
