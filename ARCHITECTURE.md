            }
        ]
    }
}
```

---

## Data Flow & Orchestration

### Workflow Execution Steps

1. **Initialization**
   ```python
   # User submits profile through Streamlit
   POST /v1/langgraph/generate-fitness-plan/
   {
       "user_id": "user_123",
       "generate_meal_plan": true,
       "generate_workout_plan": true,
       "days": 7,
       "meal_preferences": {"days": 7, "meal_count": 3},
       "workout_preferences": {"days_per_week": 4}
   }
   ```

2. **Profile Processing**
   - LangGraph invokes Profile Manager Agent
   - Agent calculates BMR, TDEE, and macro targets
   - Results stored in workflow state

3. **Plan Generation**
   - Meal Planner and Workout Planner agents process user profile data
   - Each agent has access to profile data from state
   - Vector search and database queries executed

4. **Plan Synthesis**
   - Summary Agent combines all outputs
   - Generates coherent implementation guidance
   - Creates motivational content

5. **Response Delivery**
   ```json
   {
       "summary": "Your personalized 7-day plan...",
       "meal_plan": {...},
       "workout_plan": {...},
       "execution_steps": ["Profile analyzed", "Meal plan created", ...],
       "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
   }
   ```

### State Management

LangGraph maintains state throughout the workflow:

```python
class WorkflowState:
    user_profile: Dict
    nutrition_targets: Dict
    meal_plan: Dict
    workout_plan: Dict
    execution_log: List[str]
    errors: List[str]
```

## Vector Search & RAG

### USDA Nutrition Database

**Data Size**: 3.1GB JSON file with 4500k+ branded foods, sampled down to 5k foods
**Storage**: MongoDB for structured queries
**Vector Search**: FAISS for semantic similarity

### Vector Embedding Process

1. **Enhanced Food Description Embedding**
   ```python
   # Create rich embeddings for food descriptions with context
   def create_enhanced_description(food_item):
       return f"{food_item['description']} {food_item.get('brand_owner', '')} "\
              f"ingredients: {food_item.get('ingredients', '')} "\
              f"serving: {food_item.get('serving_size', '')} "\
              f"category: {food_item.get('food_category', '')}"
   
   descriptions = [
       create_enhanced_description(food) for food in nutrition_data
   ]
   
   # Batch processing for efficient embedding creation
   batch_size = 100
   for i in range(0, len(descriptions), batch_size):
       batch = descriptions[i:i+batch_size]
       embeddings = embedding_model.embed_documents(batch)
       faiss_index.add(embeddings)
   ```

2. **Advanced Hybrid Search Implementation**
   ```python
   def search_nutrition_hybrid(query: str, limit: int = 10, semantic_weight: float = 0.7):
       # Semantic search component
       query_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query(query)
       semantic_distances, semantic_indices = faiss_index.search(query_embedding, limit * 2)
       
       # Traditional text search component
       text_results = mongo_collection.find(
           {"$text": {"$search": query}},
           {"score": {"$meta": "textScore"}}
       ).limit(limit * 2)
       
       # Hybrid scoring and ranking
       combined_results = []
       for i, idx in enumerate(semantic_indices[0]):
           food_id = food_index[idx]
           semantic_score = 1 / (1 + semantic_distances[0][i])  # Convert distance to similarity
           
           # Get text search score if available
           text_score = 0
           for text_result in text_results:
               if text_result['fdc_id'] == food_id:
                   text_score = text_result.get('score', 0)
                   break
           
           # Combine scores
           final_score = (semantic_weight * semantic_score) + ((1 - semantic_weight) * text_score)
           combined_results.append((food_id, final_score))
       
       # Sort by combined score and return top results
       combined_results.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
       top_food_ids = [result[0] for result in combined_results[:limit]]
       
       return mongo_collection.find({"fdc_id": {"$in": top_food_ids}})
   ```

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Process**:
1. User requests "high protein breakfast options"
2. Vector search finds relevant foods: greek yogurt, eggs, protein powder
3. LLM generates meal combinations using retrieved foods
4. Output includes specific nutrition data and preparation instructions

**Example**:
```python
def generate_meal_with_rag(meal_type: str, macro_targets: dict):
    # Search for relevant foods
    relevant_foods = vector_search.similarity_search(
        f"{meal_type} high protein {macro_targets['primary_macro']}"
    )
    
    # LLM creates meal using retrieved foods
    meal = llm.invoke([
        ("system", "Create a meal using these specific foods..."),
        ("human", f"Foods: {relevant_foods}, Targets: {macro_targets}")
    ])
    
    return meal
```

# Dual Database System & Smart Food Sampling

### Overview

The AI Fitness Planner implements a sophisticated dual database system that balances comprehensive nutrition data access with optimal performance. This system includes both a full database with 450K+ foods and an intelligently sampled subset of 5K foods.

### Database Selection Strategy

```python
# Dynamic database selection based on use case
def get_database_collection(use_full_database: bool = False):
    collection_name = "branded_foods" if use_full_database else "branded_foods_sample"
    return db[collection_name]
```

# Smart Food Sampling Process

The smart sampling system creates representative subsets of the massive USDA nutrition database for efficient processing and improved user experience. This system balances comprehensive nutrition data access with performance optimization by intelligently sampling foods across macro categories.

## Data Challenge

**Scale**: The complete USDA FoodData Central branded foods dataset contains over 450,000 food items in a 3.1GB JSON file, making it impractical to process in real-time for every user request.

**Solution**: Implement a smart sampling strategy that maintains nutritional diversity while reducing dataset size by 98% (from 4500K+ to 5K foods) without losing essential food variety.

## Sampling Strategy

### Even Distribution Across Macro Categories

The sampling process ensures balanced representation across four primary macro categories:

```python
macro_categories = ["high_protein", "high_fat", "high_carb", "balanced"]
foods_per_category = sample_size // len(macro_categories)  # 1,250 foods per category for 5K sample
```

### Category Definitions

Foods are classified based on their macronutrient profile (per 100g):

- **High Protein**: ≥40% of calories from protein
- **High Fat**: ≥40% of calories from fat  
- **High Carb**: ≥40% of calories from carbohydrates
- **Balanced**: No single macro exceeds 40% of calories

### Sampling Algorithm

```python
@nutrition_setup.post("/sample_usda_data/")
async def sample_usda_data(
    file_path: str = "./fast_api/app/api/nutrition_data/extracted/FoodData_Central_branded_food_json_2025-04-24.json",
    sample_size: int = 5000,
):
    """
    Sample USDA Branded Foods data evenly across macro categories
    
    Process:
    1. Query MongoDB for foods by macro category
    2. Random sample from each category
    3. Extract specific foods from USDA JSON
    4. Enhance with nutrition calculations
    5. Save optimized dataset
    """
```

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: MongoDB Category Sampling

```python
# Connect to preprocessed MongoDB collection
client = get_mongo_client()
collection = db["branded_foods"]

# Sample evenly from each macro category
for category in macro_categories:
    query = {
        "nutrition_enhanced.macro_breakdown.primary_macro_category": category,
        "nutrition_enhanced": {"$exists": True},
        "fdcId": {"$exists": True}
    }
    
    # Get all foods in category and randomly sample
    foods_in_category = list(collection.find(query, {"fdcId": 1, "_id": 0}))
    sampled_foods = random.sample(foods_in_category, category_sample_size)
    all_sampled_fdc_ids.extend([food["fdcId"] for food in sampled_foods])
```

### Phase 2: Efficient JSON Extraction

```python
# Use ijson for memory-efficient streaming of large JSON file
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    parser = ijson.items(f, "BrandedFoods.item")
    
    for food in parser:
        food_fdc_id = str(food.get("fdcId", ""))
        if food_fdc_id in fdc_id_set:
            sampled_foods.append(food)
            fdc_id_set.remove(food_fdc_id)  # Remove to avoid duplicates
            
            # Stop when all foods found
            if not fdc_id_set:
                break
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Nutrition Processing

Each sampled food undergoes comprehensive nutrition enhancement:

#### Per-100g Standardization
```python
def calculate_per_100g_values(food_item):
    """Calculate standardized per-100g nutrition values"""
    serving_size = food_item.get("servingSize", 100)
    multiplier = 100 / serving_size
    
    # Extract key nutrients by USDA nutrient IDs
    nutrient_map = {
        1008: "energy_kcal",    # Energy
        1003: "protein_g",      # Protein  
        1004: "total_fat_g",    # Total Fat
        1005: "carbs_g",        # Carbohydrates
        1079: "fiber_g",        # Fiber
        2000: "sugars_g",       # Sugars
        1093: "sodium_mg",      # Sodium
        1253: "cholesterol_mg", # Cholesterol
        1258: "saturated_fat_g",# Saturated Fat
        1257: "trans_fat_g",    # Trans Fat
    }
    
    for nutrient_id, nutrient_name in nutrient_map.items():
        amount = extract_nutrient_by_id(food_nutrients, nutrient_id)
        per_100g[nutrient_name] = round(amount * multiplier, 2)
```

#### Nutrition Density Scoring
```python
def calculate_nutrition_density_score(per_100g):
    """Calculate nutrition quality score"""
    protein = per_100g.get("protein_g", 0)
    fiber = per_100g.get("fiber_g", 0)
    calories = per_100g.get("energy_kcal", 1)
    
    if calories > 0:
        return round((protein + fiber) / calories * 100, 2)
    return 0
```

#### Macro Breakdown Analysis
```python
def calculate_macro_breakdown(per_100g):
    """Calculate detailed macronutrient analysis"""
    protein_g = per_100g.get("protein_g", 0)
    fat_g = per_100g.get("total_fat_g", 0)
    carbs_g = per_100g.get("carbs_g", 0)
    
    # Calculate calories from each macro
    calories_from_protein = protein_g * 4
    calories_from_fat = fat_g * 9
    calories_from_carbs = carbs_g * 4
    total_calculated_kcal = calories_from_protein + calories_from_fat + calories_from_carbs
    
    # Calculate percentages and categorization
    if total_calculated_kcal > 0:
        pct_protein = (calories_from_protein / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        pct_fat = (calories_from_fat / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        pct_carbs = (calories_from_carbs / total_calculated_kcal) * 100
        
        # Determine macro categories
        macro_categories = []
        if pct_protein >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_protein")
        if pct_fat >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_fat")
        if pct_carbs >= 40: macro_categories.append("high_carb")
        
        return {
            "protein_percent": round(pct_protein, 1),
            "fat_percent": round(pct_fat, 1),
            "carbs_percent": round(pct_carbs, 1),
            "macro_categories": macro_categories,

    """
    profile = state["profile"]
    
    # Load optimized sample dataset
    sampled_foods = load_sampled_nutrition_data()
    
    # Vector search on smaller, faster dataset
    relevant_foods = vector_search.similarity_search(
        query=generate_meal_query(profile),
        data=sampled_foods,
        filters=apply_dietary_restrictions(profile)
    )
    
    # LLM creates meal plan with curated food options
    meal_plan = llm.invoke([
        ("system", "Create meals using these nutritionally optimized foods..."),

    ])
    
    return {"meal_plan": meal_plan}
```

### Search Performance Optimization
```python
def enhanced_food_search_with_samples(query: str, user_restrictions: List[str] = None):
    """
    Lightning-fast food search using sampled dataset
    """
    # Search pre-processed sample instead of full database
    search_start = time.time()
    
    # Semantic search on optimized embeddings
    semantic_results = faiss_sample_index.search(query_embedding, limit=20)
    
    # Apply user-specific filters
    filtered_results = apply_user_filters(semantic_results, user_restrictions)
    
    search_duration = time.time() - search_start
    logger.info(f"Sample search completed in {search_duration:.3f}s")
    
    return filtered_results
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_food_embeddings(food_id: str):
    return faiss_index.search(food_embeddings[food_id])
```

2. **Async Processing**
```python
async def sequential_agent_execution():
    meal_plan = await meal_planner_agent(state)
    workout_plan = await workout_planner_agent(state)
    return meal_plan, workout_plan
```

3. **Database Optimization**
```python
# MongoDB indexes for fast nutrition queries
db.nutrition.create_index([("description", "text")])
db.nutrition.create_index([("brand_owner", 1)])
db.nutrition.create_index([("food_category", 1)])
```

### Error Handling

```python
def robust_agent_execution(agent_func, state, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return agent_func(state)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                return {"error": f"Agent failed after {max_retries} attempts: {e}"}
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

### Monitoring & Observability

```python
def log_workflow_execution(workflow_id: str, step: str, duration: float):
    logger.info(f"Workflow {workflow_id}: {step} completed in {duration:.2f}s")
    
    # Send metrics to monitoring system
    metrics.histogram("workflow.step.duration", duration, tags={"step": step})
```
